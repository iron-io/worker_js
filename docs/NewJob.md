**delay** | **Integer** | Number of seconds to wait before queueing the job for consumption for the first time. Must be a positive integer. Jobs with a delay start in state \&quot;delayed\&quot; and transition to \&quot;running\&quot; after delay seconds. | [optional] [default to 0]
**timeout** | **Integer** | Maximum runtime in seconds. If a consumer retrieves the\njob, but does not change it&#39;s status within timeout seconds, the job\nis considered failed, with reason timeout (Titan may allow a small\ngrace period).

Automatic retries are performed by titan when a task reaches a failed state and has &#x60;max_retries&#x60; &gt; 0. A retry is performed by queueing a new job with the same image id and payload. The new job&#39;s max_retries is one less than the original. The new job&#39;s &#x60;retry_of&#x60; field is set to the original Job ID.  Titan will delay the new job for retries_delay seconds before queueing it. Cancelled or successful tasks are never automatically retried.\&quot;\n | [optional] [default to 3]
